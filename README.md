<h1>Hi, I’m Mellow!</h1>

I'm a hobbist artist. I draw comics about my own universe and occasional drawings of my friends original characters.
<br>
I'm into drawing for 15 years, since I've finished kindergarten, but due to my cartoonish artstyle and frequent breaks it might not show.
<br>
I am familiar to the following graphic programs:
- Krita
- Gimp
- Paint
- OpenCanvas7
- mdiapp+ SE
- OpenToonz
